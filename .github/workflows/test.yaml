# This is the list of jobs that will be run concurrently.
# Since we use a build matrix, the actual number of jobs
# started depends on how many configurations the matrix

  # This is the name of the job - can be whatever.

    # Here we tell GitHub that the jobs must be determined
    # dynamically depending on a matrix configuration.

      matrix:
        # The matrix will produce one job for each configuration
        # parameter of type `arduino-platform`, in this case a
        # total of 2.
        arduino-platform: ["arduino:avr"]
        # This is usually optional but we need to statically define the
        # FQBN of the boards we want to test for each platform. In the
        # future the CLI might automatically detect and download the core
        # needed to compile against a certain FQBN, at that point the
        # following `include` section will be useless.

          # This works like this: when the platformn is "arduino:samd", the
          # variable `fqbn` is set to "arduino:samd:nano_33_iot".

        uses: actions/checkout@DEV

      # We use the `arduino/setup-arduino-cli` action to install and
      # configure the Arduino CLI on the system.
      - name: Setup Arduino CLI
        uses: arduino/setup-arduino-cli@v1.0.0

      # We then install the platform, which one will be determined
      # dynamically by the build matrix.

      # Finally, we compile the sketch, using the FQBN that was set
